The dataset for this project is a datset related to water quality measurements in small rivers in Flanders. The dataset has 4211 rows of 15 variables:

nitrate: 
	Yearly maximum nitrate concentration in the river [mg N/L]
year: 
	Year of measurement
rainfall: 
	Cumulative rainfall in the month leading up to the measurement [mm]
oxygen: 
	Oxygen saturation [%]
area: 
	area of farmland divided by total upstream area [%] 0 –> no farming, 1 –> all farmland
emission:
	emmission of N by animals divided by area of farmland [kg / m²]
stockage:
	stockage of manure in a year [kg / m²]
grass:
	area of grass divided by area of farmland [%]
vegetableG1:
	area of vegetables in group G1 divided by area of farmland [%]
vegetableG2:
	area of vegetables in group G2 divided by area of farmland [%]
vegetableG3:
	area of vegetables in group G3 divided by area of farmland [%]
catchcrop:
	Factor indicating whether yes or no a catchcrop is planted. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_crop)
norm_N:
	threshold of N to be applied on the field [kg / m²]
depostion:
	depostion of N from the air in the total upstream area [kg / m²]
